// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we make a variable called name and set it to Dane as a string value.
// we then check if the name is equal to Mary
// if its not true then we console log "How do you do?"
// the statement is false because the name is equal to Dane so we console log "How do you do?"

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we are establishing secret as a variable but not setting it to anything yet
// we make variable code and set it to 123
// we check that code is equal to 123
// we set variable secret to super
// we set code to code *2
// we check that code is greater than 250
// we set secret to duper
// we console log super

//CODE
/*
let secret;

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we create variable isStudent and set it to boolean true  
// we create variable age and set it to number 34
// we create variable zip and set it to number 55407
// we create an if statment checking if isStudent is equal to true and check if zip is greater than 8000 
// if that statement is true we console log "You're a student on the West Coast!"
// we create an else if statement checking if isStudent equals false or age is less than 30
// if that statement is true we console log "What are your hobbies?"
// we create an else if statement checking if isStudent equals true
// if that statement is true we console log "Welcome to Prime!"
// we create an else statement and if all the other statements are false we console log " How about the weather?"
// we console log "Welcome to Prime"

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
//FIX - colorOne should be set to 'blue' not 'red'
let colorOne = 'red';
//FIX - colorTwo should be set to 'red' not 'blue'
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;
FIX || should be changed to an && because the directions say 'and' not 'or'
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;
FIX should be >= because the directions say greater than or equals not less than or equals
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
